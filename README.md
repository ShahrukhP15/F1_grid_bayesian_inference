## Reading The Data

The dataset `full_data.csv` is included in the repository. If you need to regenerate 
it from scratch using the `f1dataR` package, use the following code (note this takes a long time to run):

```r
# install.packages("f1dataR")

library(f1dataR)

# Load the pre-compiled dataset containing all seasons (2019–2024)
full_data <- map_dfr(2019:2024, function(year) {
  schedule <- load_schedule(season = year)
  map_dfr(seq_len(nrow(schedule)), function(round) {
    tryCatch(
      load_results(season = year, round = round) %>%
        mutate(
          season = year,
          round = round,
          race_name = schedule$race_name[round],
          circuit = schedule$circuit_id[round],
          top_speed_kph = as.numeric(top_speed_kph),
          fastest_rank = as.integer(fastest_rank)
        ),
      error = function(e) {
        message("Skipping season ", year, " round ", round, ": ", e$message)
        NULL
      }
    )
  })
})

write_csv(full_data, "full_data.csv")
```
